I'm Paul Chibueze a Full Stack Web developer. I have a certification on Cloud Associate Engineer and Cloud DevOps from Google and Amazon web services. Being a developer i believe in taking responsibilities and solving real world problems. Team work and good communication and coordination is my top priority over the course of my career till now. Writing not just codes but a good code is  my watchword as a developer. I use model day technologies and can atest for proficiency on both JavaScript, ReactJS as its framework, Python and Django its framework, NodeJS for exclusive backend, MongoDB, mySQL, Postgres as data warehouses. Apparently, i develop and integrate Restful API's for applications interfaces too. However, in my field of Cloud development, i work with S3 buckets, EC2 instances, RDS data warehouses and lots more. However, I've also pertaked on so many Hackatons and Developers lead events and i experienced the effects and models of working as a team. On my free time I do freelancing on Upwork while in the university as a CS student. I'm currently open for Internships on both Web FullStack roles, Cloud developments and Python developer.
